# About

This is an express app to display data about ENS domains, from the Graph.

# How to Run

Note: you'll need an API key from the graph, and you'll need to change the part of the code where I specify that API key, for this to work.

You can run the app locally by running these commands:

cd <directory>

npm install 

npm start

Go to localhost:3000 and you should see the data displayed.
